## What's this?

This is a Rails engine with a basic functionality of customizable blocks of
content attachable to objects. It's not attached to any particular CMS so you
can use it freely within your Rails application without too much dependencies.

## How do I use this?

1. [Install the gem into your app](./doc/install.md)
2. [Configure some layouts for your blocks](./doc/layouts.md)
3. [Define templates and zones where your blocks fit](./doc/templates.md)
4. [Add blocks to your model](./doc/models.md)
5. [Render the blocks in your templates](./doc/render.md)
6. [Be careful with the cache](./doc/cache.md)
7. [And use a god admin interface :)](./doc/admin.md)
